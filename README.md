The purpose of this application is to simulate a store. A list of items is given as an option for purchase followed by a request for how many of each item is wanted. Finally, the stock level is checked and if available, the purchase is completed with a listing of items purchased and the total cost.  

Task 1 - show all items available for sale by product ID, Item and Price:

Task 2 - The app should then prompt users with two messages. 
  The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
  The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
